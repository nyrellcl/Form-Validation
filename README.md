# What Is It
This project is aimed to accomplish validating the user's information. It aims to validate if they are a registered user, if not they are able
to sign up using Google, Facebook, or through the website itself. Each information input is meant to verify the user's username, email and password. 
The back-end's goal is to have an ongoing "engine" where it will check to see the user's input and confirm whether or not the information they put
is sufficient for registering. 


# Form-Validation
I created this project while following a tutorial provided by freeCodeCamp. I've been struggling with firmly grasping Javascript and where I could start
making basic projects. I saw this form validation post from their blog and it like a very simple project. This involved a good amount of Javascript 
and I though it was perfect for me to practice with.

# What I learned

This project was extremely helpful in understanding how Javascript is implemented into a website/project. I've been really confused on the process of
briding all three(HTML, CSS, JS) together in a project. Creating this really helped frame for me a good understanding on how it works. It also helped me
understand more JS structures and concepts. I intend to find and follow more project tutorials so I can strengthen my JS skills even more.
