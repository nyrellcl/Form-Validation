# Form-Validation
I created this project while following a tutorial provided by freeCodeCamp. I've been struggling with firmly grasping Javascript and where I could start
making basic projects. I saw this form validation post from their blog and it like a very simple project. This involved a good amount of Javascript 
and I though it was perfect for me to practice with.

# What I learned

This project was extremely helpful in understanding how Javascript is implemented into a website/project. I've been really confused on the process of
briding all three(HTML, CSS, JS) together in a project. Creating this really helped frame for me a good understanding on how it works. It also helped me
understand more JS structures and concepts. I intend to find and follow more project tutorials so I can strengthen my JS skills even more.
